<p>The first six months of Divvy have been a great success!</p>
<p>With more than 725,000 trips and over 11,000 members, weâ€™re just getting started. We currently have 300 stations all across the city, but will be adding 175 more stations in 2014. With 475 stations, Divvy will be the bike share system with the most stations in North America! With these new stations we'll be able to expand in all directions into new neighborhoods while also filling in gaps in the current service area.</p>
<p>We hope that this is just the beginning of our expansion, but we need your help. We have just launched this page where you can make suggestions for locations of new Divvy stations.</p>

<p>On this map, you'll see:</p>
<ul style="font-weight:bold;margin:0 0 0.5em 33px;padding-left:0;list-style:none;">
  <li class="clearfix"><img src="/static/css/images/marker-station-existing.png" style="height:35px;width:auto;float:left;margin-left:-33px;"> Current Stations</li>
  <li class="clearfix"><img src="/static/css/images/marker-comment-new.png" style="margin-right:3px;float:left;margin-left:-31px;"> Suggested Stations by the Public</li>
</ul>
<p>Because you know your neighborhoods best, we ask that you use this page to suggest new stations and provide comments on existing ones.</p>
<p>All of your input will be considered by the Divvy Siting Team.</p>
<p>Please feel free to share this page (<a href="http://suggest.divvybikes.com">suggest.divvybikes.com</a>) with your friends, family, and community for their feedback.</p>
