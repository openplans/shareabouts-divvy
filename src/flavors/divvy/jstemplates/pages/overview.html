<p>Hi Chicago,</p>
<p>The first year of Divvy has been a wonderful success.</p>
<p>We currently have 300 stations all across the city, but will be adding 175 more stations in 2014&mdash;making us the bike share system with the most stations in North America! With these new stations we'll be able to expand north, south, and west into new neighborhoods as well as fill in gaps in the current service area.</p>
<p>To that end, we need your help!</p>
<p>On this map, you'll see:</p>
<ul style="font-weight:bold;margin:0 0 0.5em 33px;padding-left:0;list-style:none;">
  <li class="clearfix"><img src="/static/css/images/marker-station-existing.png" style="height:35px;width:auto;float:left;margin-left:-33px;"> Current Stations</li>
  <li class="clearfix"><img src="/static/css/images/marker-comment-new.png" style="margin-right:3px;float:left;margin-left:-31px;"> Suggested Stations by the Public</li>
</ul>
<p>We'd love for you to suggest new stations as well as show your support for and comment on suggested and current stations.</p>
<p>All of your input will be considered by the Divvy Siting Team.</p>
<p>Please feel free to share this page (<a href="http://suggest.divvybikes.com">suggest.divvybikes.com</a>) with your friends, family, and community for their feedback. Thanks for all your support. </p>
